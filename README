NAME
    Unix::Groups - Perl to support "getgroups" and "setgroups" syscalls

SYNOPSIS
     use Unix::Groups qw/:all/;

     $ngroups_max=NGROUPS_MAX;
     @gids=getgroups;
     $success=setgroups(@gids);

INSTALLATION
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a very thin layer around the getgroups(2) and
    setgroups(2) syscalls. See your system manual for more information.

    Note, the module is written and tested on Linux. For other UNIX-like
    systems there are good chances that it will work at least if it compiles
    properly.

  Functions
   $n=NGROUPS_MAX
    returns the max. number of arguments that "setgroups" will accept.

   @gids=getgroups
    returns the list of supplementary group IDs of the current process. It
    is very similar to the $( variable. But $( is a string and its first
    element is the current effective GID.

   $success=setgroups @gids
    sets the list of supplementary group IDs of the current process. On most
    systems this is a privileged operation. On Linux "CAP_SETGID" is
    required.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

    On demand all functions are exported.

   Export tags
    :all
        export all functions.
